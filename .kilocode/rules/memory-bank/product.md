# Product Description

## What is Extension-Objective?

Extension-Objective is a SillyTavern extension that enables AI characters to work autonomously towards user-defined objectives through intelligent task management. This extension transforms static AI interactions into dynamic, goal-oriented conversations where the AI actively pursues objectives through structured task completion.

## Problems It Solves

- **Static AI Interactions**: Traditional AI chat lacks autonomous goal pursuit and sequential task management
- **Manual Task Tracking**: Users need to manually guide AI through multi-step objectives
- **Lack of Context Persistence**: AI forgets objectives between messages without proper task management
- **Limited Goal Achievement**: No systematic approach for AI to break down and complete complex objectives

## How It Works

### Core Workflow
1. **Objective Setting**: User defines a high-level goal (e.g., "Plan a heist", "Organize a party", "Take over the world")
2. **Task Generation**: AI automatically breaks down the objective into sequential, actionable tasks
3. **Autonomous Execution**: AI works towards task completion during normal conversation
4. **Progress Tracking**: System automatically checks task completion and advances to next tasks
5. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Tasks can be edited, branched into subtasks, or manually managed

### Key Features
- **Hierarchical Task Trees**: Tasks can be branched into parent-child relationships for complex objectives
- **Automatic Task Checking**: Configurable AI-powered completion detection
- **Manual Override**: Full user control over task creation, editing, deletion, and completion
- **Contextual Integration**: Tasks are injected into chat prompts at configurable depth levels
- **Custom Prompts**: Fully customizable AI prompts for task generation and completion checking
- **Session Persistence**: Tasks and progress saved per chat session

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Experience
- **Effortless Setup**: Simple objective input with one-click task generation
- **Transparent Progress**: Clear visibility into current tasks and completion status
- **Flexible Control**: Balance between automation and manual intervention
- **Engaging Interaction**: AI naturally incorporates objective pursuit into roleplay

### Advanced Features
- **Task Branching**: Complex objective decomposition through parent-child task relationships
- **Stealth Mode**: Optional task hiding for mysterious AI behavior
- **Performance Tuning**: Configurable check frequency and prompt positioning for optimal experience
- **Prompt Customization**: Advanced users can modify AI behavior through custom prompts
